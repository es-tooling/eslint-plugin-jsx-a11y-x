📝 Enforce emojis are wrapped in `<span>` and provide screen reader access.

❌ This rule is deprecated.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Emoji have become a common way of communicating content to the end user. To a person using a screen reader, however, they may not be aware that this content is there at all. By wrapping the emoji in a `<span>`, giving it the `role="img"`, and providing a useful description in `aria-label`, the screen reader will treat the emoji as an image in the accessibility tree with an accessible name for the end user.
