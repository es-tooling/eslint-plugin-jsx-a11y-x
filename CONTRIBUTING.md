## Ways to contribute

There are various ways to get involved. Here are a few suggestions of things we'd love some help with.

#### Resolving existing issues

You can consider helping out with issues already requiring attention - look for a "help wanted" label.

#### Reporting issues

If you run into problems in the project, you can report them by opening a new issue and providing as much context as you can about what you're running into, along with a failing test or code sample to help others verify and ultimately fix the issue.

> **Note:** Before filing an issue, please check both open and closed issues to see if the problem has already been reported.

#### Documentation

We are happy to welcome contributions from anyone willing to improve documentation by adding missing information or making it more consistent and coherent.

## Dev Environment

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), preferably with [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

- [Fork the repo and clone your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

- Get all dependencies

  ```sh
  yarn
  ```

- Add the upstream source for being able to sync main project changes back into your fork. For example, to configure an upstream remote repository for the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` fork, run:

  ```sh
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/es-tooling/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y-x.git
  ```

- Run the tests and the build

  ```sh
  yarn test
  ```

- Make and submit changes to the project source files following our [pull request submission workflow](#pull-requests)

## Pull requests

Create a new branch

```sh
git checkout -b issue1234
```

Commit the changes to your branch, including a coherent commit message that follows our [standards](#commit-messages)

```sh
git commit -a
```

Before sending the pull request, make sure your code is running on the latest available code by rebasing onto the upstream source

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Verify your changes

```sh
yarn test
# or
yarn tests-only
yarn lint
```

Push your changes

```sh
git push origin issue1234
```

Send the [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests), make requested changes, and get merged
